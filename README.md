# English Language Wiki

This wiki compiles practical information about learning English that I have picked up in my years of teaching. Since I have many students from the tech world and since this wiki is on Github, many of my examples will come from the software sphere. However, I hope that anyone who is trying to improve their English--even natives-- may find some benefit. 

My emphasis is on practical applications of the langage. Wherever possible, I will use examples from the real world, and examine mistakes that I saw in the classroom or in real life.
