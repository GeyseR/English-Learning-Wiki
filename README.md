# English Language Wiki

This wiki compiles practical information about learning English that I have
picked up in my years of teaching. Since I have many students from the tech
world and since this wiki is on Github, many of my examples will come from the
software sphere. However, I hope that anyone who is trying to improve their
English--even natives-- may find some benefit. 


My emphasis is on practical applications of the langage. Wherever possible, I
will use examples from the real world, and examine mistakes that I saw in the
classroom or in real life.
