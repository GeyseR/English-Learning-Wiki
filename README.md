# English Language Wiki

This wiki compiles practical information about learning English that I have picked up in my years of teaching. Since I have many students from the tech world and since this wiki is on Github, many of my examples will come from the software sphere. However, I hope that anyone who is trying to improve their English--even natives-- may find some benefit. 

To be of practical use is the primary aim of this wiki. To demonstrate that the contents herein are not purely theoretical matters, the contents will favor the use of real-world examples (and real-world mistakes) as often as possible.
